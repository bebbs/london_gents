#TrendMapper

Trend Mapper

Introduction
--------------------

For our mini Makerthon we set about to map London's trendiest and most up and coming areas for 20 to 35 year olds, based on data and statistics we highlighted as showing whether an area was hot or not.

We used some of the freely available government data found on London's data store to build our algorithm and index. The data store is a local authority project designed to "enhance the lives of Londoners, create new businesses and answer city problems" through the provision of datasets and API's which the public & businesses are free to use.

We also utilised Instagrams API to show the latest images hashtagged under the area names for the district you clicked on, this we felt would provide some more background to the culture and happenings of that chosen area.

Highlights
-----------------

The teams highlights included completing a working single page web application, which we can proudly say, is a very tidy looking and functional MVP.

Personally highlights for me were...

Increasing my knowledge of making requests to web based API's using jQuery and Ajax

Learning the use of a new API testing framework Hippie

Combining both Google Maps API and Instagrams API to work asynchronously on the page.

Enhancements
------------------

More granular data on the index scoring system, currently we are using house prices and age, we would like to use more fators such as liscenced premises, number of shops, coffee houses and places of cultural significance

Incorperate more data from community based web applications such as Reddit & Yelp

Break the map down to postcodes

Improve lay out and context, so user can understand more what the data represents
